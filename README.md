# Challenge: Java Tax Calculator

This challenge is part of the [Modern Developer Training](https://devsuperior.com.br) course, under the **Modern Programming** module, **Conditional Structures** chapter.

## Description
The program calculates the income tax a person must pay based on the following rules:

1. **Tax on Monthly Salary:**
   - Below R$ 3000: **Exempt**
   - From R$ 3000 to R$ 4999.99: **10%**
   - R$ 5000 or above: **20%**

2. **Other Sources of Income:**
   - Income from services: **15%**
   - Capital gains (real estate, stocks, etc.): **20%**

3. **Deductions:**
   - Medical and educational expenses can deduct up to **30% of the gross tax**.
   - If medical and educational expenses are less than 30% of the gross tax, only the actual expenses will be deducted.

## Objective
Implement the program in **Java** to:
- Read the annual values of:
  - Income from salary.
  - Income from services.
  - Capital gains.
  - Medical and educational expenses.
- Calculate and display a tax report as shown in the example.

## Solution
The code is written in `Java` and uses conditional logic to fulfill the challenge requirements.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Conditional Structures aligned with Object-Oriented Programming principles

## How to Execute
1. Make sure **Java 11** or later is installed.
